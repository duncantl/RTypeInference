[Started] Identifying updating by subset assignment.
</item>
<item>
Identify an if statement, and its different possible outcomes.
See rw2d.R and the if() in the loop.
</item>

<item>
Add information about vectorized functions and which argument tells us if they are scalars, etc.
</item>
<item>
Similarly, mark aggregator functions. sum, min, max, range, sd, mean, 
</item>

Why do we end up with 4 NAs for xpos[i] assignment in rwd2?
<r:code>
tt = inferType(rw2d1)
</r:code>
</item>


<item status="high">
For UpdateType, do we include the scalar type or the vector type if it is a single element.
</item>

<item>
When we call getType() for the typeCollector, 
take into account any UpdateType element.
Have to merge the information from the definition and the update.
</item>

<item>
Identify the length of a vector if we know it.
Also if we change it after creation.
</item>

<item status="done">
Treat a for loop as an assignment and infer the type of the loop variable.
