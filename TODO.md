# Pending:

* Special handling for subset function `[` (?)
* Inference for while loops.
* Tests for larger bodies of code (not just snippets).

# Deferred:

* Infer metadata from assignment functions such as `dim<-`
* Detect branching `return()` behavior and branch conditions; currently we just 
  assume user functions are type stable.
