Description: This package infers the types of inputs and outputs for R
    expresssions. More specifically, the purpose is to derive information about
    the variables and return values of functions and scripts based on the input
    types. This effort is complicated because R functions are very flexible in the
    types they accept and return. The primary application of type information is
    performance optimization, but other uses are possible.
