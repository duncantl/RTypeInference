Title: Tools for inferring the types of inputs and outputs for functions and expressions
Author: Duncan Temple Lang 
Maintainer: Duncan Temple Lang <duncan@r-project.org>
Description: This package is an effort to infer the types of 
  the inputs and ouputs of expressions and functions in R.
  The idea is to be able to associate information with a function
  about the possible parameter types and the return value.
  (There may be multiple input and output combinations.)
  We also want to do this for a script and identify the 
  types of each variable.  Here we may know the types of the original
  inputs or begiven hints.
  This effort is complicated because R functions are very flexible in what they 
  accept and return and as a result the types are very dynamic.
  It is further complicated when we want to differentiate between
  scalar and vector types.

Note:  Connect with the TypeInfo package, both to read type information
  users specify on functions and also as a possible way to attach
  the inferred types to a function.
