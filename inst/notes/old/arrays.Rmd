This document discusses how constraints should be generated and resolved for
sound inference of composite types.


## Arrays (R Vectors)

The simplest possible scenario for type inference on composite types is a
direct call to a zero-filled vector constructor.
```{r}
x = numeric(4)
```
In this case, the type of the right-hand side is known and inference should:

1. Bind `x#1` to the write operand.
2. Bind `x#1` to `x`.
3. Add the constraint `x#1 <=> ArrayType(RealType, 4)`

This scenario becomes more difficult when the length argument is a variable.
```{r}
n = 4
x = numeric(n)
```
