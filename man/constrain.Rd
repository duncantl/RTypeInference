\title{Generate Type Constraint Set from Expression}
\usage{
constrain(node, helper = InferHelper(counter),
  counter = rstatic::Counter$new())
}
\arguments{
\item{node}{ASTNode. Expression from which to generate type constraints.}

\item{helper}{InferHelper. Helper object for constraint generation.}

\item{counter}{Counter. Counter for uniquely naming type variables.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements. The first is the list of constraints, and
the second is the final state of the helper object.
}
\description{
This function generates a set of type constraints from the given expression,
which can then be solved to infer types for the expression.
}
